## Tidyverse

What is the relationship between tidyverse and readr? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "tidyverse is a package in the readr family of packages", 
    answer ="readr is a package in the tidyverse family of packages",
    "tidyverse and readr are two unrelated packages",
    "tidyverse and reader are two names for the same package"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

In the tidyverse, what does "tidy data" refer to? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "any data we load into the tidyverse",
    "a dataset with no missing values",
    answer="a standard way to organize a dataset",
    "the process of cleaning a dataset"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

What is the purpose of the `purrr` package? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "Data visualization",
    "Data wrangling",
    "Data importing",
    answer="Functional programming",
    "All of the above"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

What is the primary purpose of the `readr` package? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "Data visualization",
    "Data wrangling",
    answer="Data importing",
    "Functional programming",
    "All of the above"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

Which of the following returned this message? 

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer="`library(tidyverse)`",
    "`family(tidyverse)`",
    "`library.collection(tidyverse)`",
    "`library(tidyverse, report=TRUE)`"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```


## purrr 

Suppose we have the following tibble, stored with the variable `df`. What will `map(df, mean)` return? 

```{r}
#| echo: false

df <- tibble(
    x = 1:4,
    y = 5:8,
    z = 9:12
)
print(df)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "the mean of each row",
    answer="the mean of each column",
    "the mean of all values",
    "Error: cannot compute mean of type integer"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```


Suppose we wanted to coerce each column in the previous tibble to the data type `double` with one line of code. Fill in the two arguments to `map` that would accomplish this: 

- map(`r fitb("df", width = 10)`, `r fitb("as.double", width = 10)`)



## Tibbles

Suppose we run the following code block. What will `is.data.frame(tib)` return? 

```r
tib <- tibble(x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(answer ="True","False")

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

What will `typeof(tib)` return? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "double", 
    "character",
    "`double` • `character`",
    answer ="list",
    "tibble",
    "data.frame"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

Which of the following would convert a dataframe, `df`, to a tibble?  


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer ="as_tibble(df)", 
    "`as.data.frame(df, tibble)`",
    "`tribble(df)`",
    answer ="`df %>% as_tibble()`",
    answer = "`df |> as_tibble()`"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

Suppose we run the following code, what will `is_tibble()` return? 

```r
x <- tribble(
    ~x, ~y, 
    2, 3, 
    4, 5
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer ="True",
    "False"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```



Suppose we create the following tibble, `tib`, what will `tib$a` return?

```{r}
#| echo: false
(tib <- tibble(
    age = c(1, 2, 3, 5),
    name = c("dory", "hazel", "graham", "joan"),
    alt_name = c("dolores", NA, NA, "joanie")
))
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer="an error", 
    "`age` via partial matching",
    "`age` and `alt_name` via partial matching",
    "`hazel`, `graham`, `joan`, and `joanie` via partial matching",
    "an empty vector"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```


## readr 

Many questions below refer to this dataset, borrowed from R4DS and available at the url [https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv](https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv).

What does the csv in `read_csv()` stand for? Fill in the blank. 

- `r fitb("comma", width = 10)` separated values 


Suppose we attempt to import the csv file given above with the code below. What will be the result? 

```r
data <- read_csv("https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv",
    col_types = list(AGE = col_double())
)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "imports with no errors or warnings",
    "fails to import, throws error", 
    answer="imports, but with a warning that there are parsing issues",
    "imports, but changes the column name to `age`"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```



Suppose we import the dataset given above and name it `data`. What will `is.na(data[3,3])` return? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "True",
    answer="False"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

Suppose we import the dataset given above and name it `data`. Which of the following would return the first column? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer="`data[1]`",
    answer="`data[[1]]`",
    "`data[[Student ID]]`",
    answer="```data[[`Student ID`]]```"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

True or false, assuming the same dataset the following code would rename the `Student ID` column to `student_id`? 

```r
data %>% rename(student_id = `Student ID`)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    answer="True",
    "False"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```

True or false, we can use a `read_*()` function from `readr` to import a google sheet.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the answer choices
choices <- c(
    "True",
    answer="False"
)

cat(longmcq(choices))
```
