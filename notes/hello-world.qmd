## Data science

> Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation.<br><br>

## Overview of the course

Topics: 

- **Learn R** - we will spend the first few weeks getting comfortable programming in R, including some useful skills for data science:
    - R basics
    - Data importing
    - Data visualization 
    - Data wrangling 
- **Foundations** - we will spend the next several weeks building a foundation in basic statistics and model building 
    - Probability distributions
    - Sampling variability
    - Hypothesis testing
    - Model specification
    - Model fitting 
    - Model accuracy
    - Model reliability
- **Specials** - finally we will cover a selection of more advanced topics that are often applied in language and mind fields, with a focus on basic understanding: 
    - Inference for regression
    - Classification
    - Feature engineering (preprocessing) 
    - Mixed-effect models

Typical week: 

- **Lecture** (Tue and Thu) - conceptual overview of core topics and programming tutorials 
- **Lab** (Thu or Fri) - ungraded practice problems and review with TAs

Assessments: 

- **6 Problem sets** - applying programming skills
- **4 Quizzes** - testing understanding of concepts (similar to lab practice questions)

## Why R? 

With many programming languages available for data science (e.g. R, Python, Julia, MATLAB), why use R?

- Built for stats, specifically 
- Makes nice visualizations
- Lots of people are doing it, especially in academia
- Easier for beginners to understand
- Free and open source (though so are Python and Julia, MATLAB costs $)

If you are interested, here is a [math professor's take](https://tobydriscoll.net/blog/matlab-vs.-julia-vs.-python/) on the differences between Python, Julia, and MATLAB. Note that although they're optimized for different things, **they're all great** and the technical skills and conceptual knowledge you gain in this course easily transfers to other languages.

## Google Colab

There are many ways to program with R. Some popular options include:

- [R Studio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)
- and even simply the [command line/terminal](http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/R_learning_infrastructure/Using%20the%20R%20command%20line.html)

**Google Colab** is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook that allows you to write, execute, and share code like a google doc. We use Google Colab because it's simple and accessible to everyone. You can start programming right away, no setup required! Google Colab officially supports Python, but secretly supports R (and [Julia](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/julia_notebooks/blob/master/Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb), too!)

New R notebook:

- [colab (r kernel)](https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true&language=r) - use this link to start a new R notebook
- `File > New notebook` error, Python! `name 'x' is not defined`

Cell types: 

- `+ Code` - write and execute code 
- `+ Text` - write text blocks in [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

Left sidebar: 

- `Table of contents` - outline from text headings
- `Find and replace` - find and/or replace 
- `Files` - upload files to cloud session

Frequently used menu options:

- `File > Locate in Drive` - where in your Google Drive?
- `File > Save` - saves
- `File > Revision history` - history of changes you made
- `File > Download > Download .ipynb` - used to submit assignments!
- `File > Print` - prints
- `Runtime > Run all` - run all cells 
- `Runtime > Run before` - run all cells before current active cell
- `Runtime > Restart and run all` - restart runtime, then run all 

Frequently used keyboard shortcuts:

- `Cmd/Ctrl+S` - save 
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` - run focused cell 
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A` - select all cells
- `Cmd/Ctrl+/` - comment/uncomment selection
- `Cmd/Ctrl+]` - increase indent
- `Cmd/Ctrl+[` - decrease indent
