## Why wrangle and tidy?
## Data wrangling with dplyr

All `dplyr` functions (verbs) share a common structure:

- 1st argument is always a data frame
- Subsequent arguments typically describe which columns to operate on (via their names) 
- Output is always a new data frame

We can group `dplyr` functions based on what they operate on:

- rows - see section 3 Manipulating rows
- columns - see section 4 Manipulating columns
- groups - see section 5 Grouping and summarizing data frames
- tables - see section 6 Joining data frames

We can easily combine `dplyr` functions to solve complex problems:

- The pipe operator, `|>` takes the output from one function and passes it as input (the first argument) to the next function.
- There is another version of the pipe, `%>%`. See the reading on data transformation if you are curious about the difference. 

*In lecture, we will demonstrate with a few `dplyr` functions, but you should feel comfortable reading the docs/resources to use others to solve unique problems.* 

## Manipulating rows

`filter()`

`arrange()`

## Manipulating columns

`select()`

`mutate()`

## Grouping and summarizing data frames

## Joining data frames

- don't cover, just show the functions and say we won't cover it

## Data tidying with tidyr

- sneak in with case study later; for now just show functions and say we won't cover it.
